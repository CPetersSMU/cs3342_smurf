This implementation of Smurf was done with C++ and cpp peg-lb on a windows machine. 

I am unsure how to claim this should be graded. Inserting in the test cases provided manually (using command line), each test case returns the appropriate value. However, when I try to run the test script, nothing prints to my screen, so I'm not sure it's working as intended. 
If the test runner also does not work for you, please grade this as the bottom right box: the fibonacci function works; it can interpret an AST with function calls and bindings. 

To use my interpreter, use "Smurf.exe", followed by one command line argument, where that argument is a string that is the code of the program you want to run.

An attempt was made at creating a makefile; however I haven't been able to get the "make" command to work on my machine, so I am unsure if it is correct.

The script to run the tests is unedited.

Thank you for your teachings. This assignment was actually a bit of fun.
